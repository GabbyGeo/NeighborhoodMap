$Neighborhood Map Project
========

Developed a single page application featuring a map of locations in Rome. The functionality of this map includes highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and a way to filter the content.

Steps Taken to Create the Application
--------

- Used the Knockout framework to handle the lists, filters and third-party data.
- Wrote code to run the application asynchronously and to handle errors with third-party data.
- Wrote code to add a full-screen map using the Google Maps API.
- Wrote code to map markers identifying seven locations.  Created a filter to allow the user to select locations based on interest.  
- Added functionality to open an infoWindow with third-party data when a marker or the list item is selected.
- The application is mobile responsive in that the list of locations is hidden off-screen with a hamburger menu to open them on mobile devices.
